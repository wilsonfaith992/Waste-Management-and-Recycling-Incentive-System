# Decentralized Waste Management and Recycling Incentive System

A blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes waste management through automated tracking, smart incentives, and community engagement.

## Overview

The Decentralized Waste Management and Recycling Incentive System leverages blockchain technology, IoT devices, and smart contracts to create a transparent, efficient, and reward-driven approach to waste management. The system encourages proper waste disposal and recycling through economic incentives while maintaining a verifiable record of all waste management activities.

## Features

### Waste Tracking System
- Real-time monitoring of waste collection and sorting activities
- Integration with IoT-enabled smart bins for automated waste measurement
- Verification system for proper waste segregation
- Dashboard for tracking individual and community waste management metrics

### Smart Contract Reward System
- Automated distribution of recycling rewards based on verified activities
- Penalty system for improper waste disposal
- Token-based incentive mechanism for consistent participation
- Smart contracts for transparent reward calculation and distribution

### NFT Achievement System
- Unique NFTs awarded for significant recycling milestones
- Collection-based gamification elements
- Community recognition through special achievement NFTs
- Tradeable environmental impact certificates

### IoT Integration
- Automated waste weight measurement
- QR code scanning for user identification
- Real-time bin capacity monitoring
- Waste composition analysis

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components
- Ethereum-based smart contracts (Solidity)
- IPFS for decentralized data storage
- Node.js API server
- MongoDB for caching and analytics

### Frontend Components
- React.js web application
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Progressive Web App support
- Real-time data visualization

### IoT Infrastructure
- Arduino-based waste bin sensors
- LoRaWAN network for device communication
- Edge computing units for local data processing
- Secure gateway infrastructure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16 or higher
- MongoDB v4.4 or higher
- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Truffle Suite for smart contract deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/waste-management-system.git
cd waste-management-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Deploy smart contracts:
```bash
truffle migrate --network <your-network>
```

5. Start the application:
```bash
npm run start
```

### Configuration

Create a `config.json` file in the root directory:

```json
{
  "network": {
    "chainId": 1,
    "rpcUrl": "https://your-rpc-url"
  },
  "contracts": {
    "rewardToken": "0x...",
    "nftContract": "0x..."
  },
  "iot": {
    "gatewayUrl": "wss://your-gateway",
    "updateInterval": 300
  }
}
```

## Smart Contract Architecture

### RewardToken.sol
- ERC20 token for recycling rewards
- Minting based on verified recycling activities
- Transfer and balance management

### RecyclingNFT.sol
- ERC721 token for achievement badges
- Metadata storage on IPFS
- Achievement criteria verification

### WasteManagement.sol
- Core logic for waste tracking
- Penalty system implementation
- Integration with IoT devices
